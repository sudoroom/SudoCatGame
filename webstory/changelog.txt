  * Better support for %, e.g. to allow WebStories with fluid stage dimensions.
  * New Background asset that stretches to fit the stage.
  * Engine split into separate files for development to be more modular.
  * Alpha support for local container apps.
  * WSE object gets it's own data bus, to allow obtaining game and interpreter references at startup.
  * Textbox asset gets an HTML-aware typewriter effect.
  * Use HTML in <line> commands directly, without the ugy {tag} syntax.
  * New side images extension.
  * Updated savegame API to make it more robust and easier to use. Also fixes: [[https://github.com/jsteinbeck/WebStory-Engine/issues/4|GitHub issue #4]]
  * Extend the Textbox definition with a <nameTemplate> element, in which {name} will be replaced by the name of the character who's speaking, if any.
  * Rename attribute 'names' on Textbox definitions to 'namebox'. The old attribute name was much too confusing.
